## **The Project**
*Hidden for centuries in an attic in Cairo, over 300,000 fragments of pre-modern and medieval Jewish texts—from everyday receipts to biblical works—have yet to be fully deciphered.*

### ***What is the identified workflow?*** 



1. Sorting the fragments by script type and level of difficulty.
2. Analyzing the sorted piles by transcribing the relatively easy fragments.
3. Noting margins, fonts, and visuals.
4. Finding key phrases that will eventually be used to help decipher the more difficult ones.

## **My Efforts - Part 1** 
### ***What did I do to contribute?***

- Identify where words end and begin:

- Interpret older fonts, or *khut*, into modern Arabic fonts:

## **My Efforts - Part 2**
### ***What did I do to contribute?***

### Again, I examine manuscript:

### I see and type:

```قلنا لنا مداخبر فله الباب الواحد```
       
### Think about meaning:

```    He told us the entrance has one door.  ```


## Lingering Thoughts and Questions

### 

***Observations***

- Community of interest
- Reveal motivations of "fun" and "social value"
- Institutionally-hosted peer production initiative

***What am I still thinking about?***

### 
- Issues with digital platform 
- No mechanism for knowing if my work has been reviewed
- No transparency of which transcription becomes the committed transcription (Fogel)
