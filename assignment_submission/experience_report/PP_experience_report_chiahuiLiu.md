Peer Production Participation Project: experience report

Before Participation

As a programming-based peer production community, Open Austin serves a good role in encouraging people contributing to the projects. During this semester, I joined Open Austin and talked with a couple of people in different projects. In overall, Open Austin has built a well-structured framework with detailed guidelines to have people get a full picture of how open-sourced projects work in the organization. However, to successfully contribute to the projects, some technical knowledge such as basic commands of GitHub and programming skills are prerequisites for people who would like to participate the projects in Open Austin.

Participation Experience

Different projects are usually initialized by different participants. During the semester, I participated two projects in Open Austin, which are voters visualizations and name a stray. Before you start contributing to the projects, Open Austin requires every participant read the Influence TX Code of Conduct. Participants are welcome to choose any of the on-going projects listed on the GitHub of Open Austin. At the very first, I reached out to the project initializers by replying an issue on GitHub separately for the two projects.

In the voters visualizations project, I received Josh’s reply in short time and I started working on some part of the code based on my interests. In the end, I finished solving the encoding issue and plotted a pie chart by Python programming to visualize the proportion of registered voters by gender, and the code changes were accepted by Josh after I created pull requests on the GitHub. The data of registered voters are released as open data by the Austin government. Overall speaking, the experience of participating the project was great as Josh and I actually communicated frequently and he helped me a lot in understanding the project. In addition, he replied to me by emails or pull requests shortly, and this is one of the main reason that drives me to keep contributing. Although I went to one of the meet-ups held by Open Austin, I didn’t see Josh in person, but this won’t keep me from contributing to the project as I have a sense of accomplishment and the feeling of being valued during the participation.

However, the later project, name a stray, didn’t make me feel in the same way as the voters visualizations. After I reached to the project initializers, the only thing I got from them is silence. The experience gained from the name a stray project makes me realize that the importance of the motivations and the governance in terms of open-sourced projects. To me, the personal motivations are not the only components that motivate participants, and the external circumstances such as the proactivity of other participants are also critical to motivate or de-motivate people.

Implications

Compared to the expectations I mentioned in the first paper, I think the voter visualizations project meets the criteria of peer production and my expectations, including the way of contribution, the communication with other participants, the motivations and the governance. In addition, the project is released under Unliscense, which meets the denotation of peer production as well. On the other hand, the other project, name a stray, didn’t work effectively as the participants, including the initiators, are not proactive. However, it makes me understand why the motivantions of participants in peer production play an essential role, and have more concrete ideas about the framework of peer production projects.
